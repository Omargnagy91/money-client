Basic idea behind that route is:

1. never change, no matter what. These links will be sent to users by email or other channels, so they need to be super-stable;
2. do not have any language specificity. We don't really want to force the locale for these actions, so we'll redirect;
3. have a very basic protection from scrappers. These endpoints would only work for JS-enabled browsers, which would make it difficult-ish for Gmail and other clients to get a grasp on the content here.
